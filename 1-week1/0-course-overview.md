# Course Overview

The syllabus (available on blackboard) is the most authoritative and up-to-date place for information about the schedule and / or policies.  You are responsible for reviewing it on a regular basis!  The instructor will strive to notify you of any updates.

## Class Flow

* This is a flipped class – you are expected to review Jupyter Notebooks and Readings for the week  _before_ class
  * Every week will include a simple assignment, due before the next class, that will help guide your work through the materials
* Class time will be devoted to answering your questions and working through exercises
  * Most work will be done in pairs
* I will call on several people randomly in each class. Everyone will be called on an equivalent number of times in a semester, and your answers will determine your participation grade (10 points total). If you are not present and have not been excused, you will receive a 0 for that question. You may receive partial or no credit if your answer is not of sufficient quality.
  
## Assignments

* **12 Weekly Assignments**
  * In most weeks, there will be a simple assignment, designed to guide you through the course materials
* **Larger Assignments**
  * There will be 3 larger assignments, designed to help you apply what you've learned to in new ways.
* **Group Project**
  * There is one group project, that will stretch out overall most of the semester. You will work in teams of 3\-5, and there will be several presentations and turn-ins.
  * Please see the syllabus for additional details
