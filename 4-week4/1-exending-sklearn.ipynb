    "## 7. Benefits of Conforming to the Estimator API\n",
    "\n",
    "By conforming to sklearn's Estimator API, we gain several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency**: Our estimator works like any other sklearn estimator, making it easier for others (and ourselves) to use.\n",
    "2. **Pipeline compatibility**: We can use our estimator in sklearn's Pipeline and FeatureUnion.\n",
    "3. **Model selection tools**: We can use tools like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning (if our estimator had hyperparameters).\n",
    "4. **Validation tools**: We can use sklearn's cross-validation tools seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now created a simple sklearn-compatible Z-score transformer! This approach allows you to integrate custom transformations seamlessly with sklearn's ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Exercise for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, try to extend this class to include:\n",
    "1. A parameter in `__init__` to optionally use median and interquartile range instead of mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "2. Error handling for division by zero (when standard deviation is zero).\n",
    "3. A method to inverse_transform the Z-scores back to the original scale.\n",

    "Happy coding!"
